            I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for turning ideas into
            results through precise code, creative designs, and fluid user
            interactions and experiences. <br />
            <br />
            I've spent my post-collegiate life working as a Physical Therapist
            assistant at skilled nursing facilities. This professional experience
            has sharpened my time management and leadership skills, tought me how
            to excel in high-stress environments, and allowed me to work with a
            variety of team members to achieve a common goal.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work and my studies I enjoy staying active and going to see
            live music. When I can, I like to push my limits through distance
            running, skydiving, and skiing. I am always open to new experiences
            and learning new skills, life is short so might as well do all you
            can!
